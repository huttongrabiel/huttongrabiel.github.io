            <p>Hi! My name is _____________ and I am a teenager born and raised in Southern California.
                Growing up in Southern California, I spent a lot of time at the beach and in the ocean. 
                I've been surfing since I was roughly ten years old and spend countless hours in the water. 
                Now, beaches are no stranger to trash and pollution, and I do my part to make a difference.
                Picking up trash and making my world a better place inspired me to share my adventures here
                on this website that I am building. This website is designed to allow you to come along with
                me as we make a difference in the world. Lets be the difference makers of our generation!

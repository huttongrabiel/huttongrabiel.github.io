            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is _____________ and I am a teenager born and raised in Southern California.
                Growing up in Southern California, I spent a lot of time at the beach and in the ocean. 
                I've been surfing since I was roughly ten years old and spend countless hours in the water. 
                For this reason I have created this organization to ensure the cleanliness of our beaches.
                We are originally based out of Corona del Mar State Beach but travel throughout Orange
                County to do our part. We strive to encourage everyone that they make a difference. 
                Now, beaches are no stranger to trash and pollution, and I do my part to make a difference.
                Picking up trash and making our world a better place inspired me to share our adventures here
                on this website. This website is designed to allow you to come along with us as we make a 
                difference in the world. Lets be the difference makers of our generation!

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment I'm a senior studying computer science at the University of Washington - Seattle. For the past year and a half
                I've also been completing the required courses for medical school (yes it has been brutal thank you for asking), conducting research,
                and finding time for the rest of life in between.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the past three years I've been involved with Husky Robotics as the software lead, taken a LOT of courses both in computer 
                science and outside it (chem, physics, biology, etc.).
            </p>

            <p>
                For research I work in the Grannan Lab at the University of Washington Medical Center where we are developing models to 
                understand speech pathways and decode behavior from neural data. There is a lot of cool work being done here involving everything
                from signal processing to AI/LLMs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, I volunteer in the Emergency Department at Seattle Children's Hospital. I love this work and it makes my whole week better.
            </p>

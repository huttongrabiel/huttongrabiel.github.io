Hi! 

My name is Hutton and I am 19 years old currently living in Seattle, WA.  I love to build software with a focus on low 
level computing. Topics like OS development, compilers, programming languages, and x86 assembly pique my 
interest. However, I'm interested in everything computing related from hardware to AI/ML, so nothing gets left out.

## Work

I am currently interning at MATRIXX Software where I've been doing a bit of everything over the past 11 months.

So far I've...  
* Reworked a bunch of DevOps related software  
    * Think knee deep in yml, shell scripts, and linux containers
* Built an automated chat support messaging system
    * iOS application built with SwiftUI
* Researched and presented on OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, and PKCE
    * In the midst of prototyping a small implementation using Ory/Hydra

## Fun
For fun I love to workout, work on projects, and contribute to open source projects like [SerenityOS](github.com/serenityOS/serenity).

## Education

I'll be attending the University of Washington-Seattle beginning September 2022.

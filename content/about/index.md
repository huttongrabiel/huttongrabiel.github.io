Hi!

My name is Hutton and I am 19 years old currently living in Seattle, WA.  I love to build software with a focus on low
level computing. Topics like OS development, compilers, programming languages, and x86 assembly pique my
interest. However, I'm interested in everything computing related from hardware to AI/ML, so nothing gets left out.

## Work

I just recently finished an 11 month internship with MATRIXX software.

During my internship I:
* Reworked a bunch of DevOps related software
    * Think knee deep in yml, shell scripts, and linux containers
* Built an automated chat support messaging system
    * iOS application built with SwiftUI
* Researched and presented on OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect, and PKCE

## Education

I'll be attending the University of Washington-Seattle beginning September 2022.
